### **2.Non-Functional Requirements**

#### **Usability**

- The application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface to allow users to navigate, manage, and search their photo albums with minimal effort.
- Support for both desktop and mobile platforms through responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- Provide multilingual support to accommodate a diverse user base.
- Offer accessibility features such as screen reader compatibility and high-contrast mode to enhance usability for users with disabilities.

#### **Performance**

- Fast response time for uploading, searching, and retrieving photos, even with large albums (target: <2 seconds for search operations).
- Scalable storage and processing to handle increasing user data and concurrent access without performance degradation.
- Efficient caching strategies (e.g., Redis or CDN) to speed up photo delivery and album loading times.

#### **Security**

- Implement secure authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0 or JWT), ensuring that only authorized users can access and manage their photos.
- Role-based access control for sharing albums (public, private, and collaborative settings).
- Secure data transmission (HTTPS/SSL encryption) and secure photo storage with encryption at rest.
- Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning to maintain application integrity.

#### **Safety & Privacy**

- Compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR or CCPA, ensuring users have control over their data and privacy settings.
- Provide options for users to delete their data permanently.
- Secure handling of personal data such as geolocation and face recognition metadata.

#### **Maintainability**

- Modular code structure and use of standard design patterns to ensure code readability, reusability, and ease of maintenance.
- Well-documented APIs and backend services.
- Automated testing (unit tests, integration tests) and CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment and monitoring.

### **3.Data Requirements**

#### **Data to be Collected and Managed**

- Photo files: Images in various formats (JPG, PNG, HEIC, etc.).
- Metadata: Extracted automatically from images (EXIF data), including:
  - Timestamp (date & time)
  - Geolocation (latitude & longitude)
  - Camera/device info
- User-generated data:
  - Custom tags (event, person names, places)
  - Album names, descriptions
  - Sharing settings (public/private/collaborative)
- AI-generated tags and labels:
  - Facial recognition data (people identification)
  - Object detection and scene recognition (events, locations)
- Edited content:
  - Modified images, cropped versions, filters applied
  - Generated videos (moment videos, timelines)

#### **How to Collect and Process Data**

- **Image Metadata Extraction**: Automatically extract EXIF data using libraries (e.g., ExifTool, Python Pillow).
- **AI Tagging & Classification**: Use OpenCV and GPT (or other AI/ML services) for face recognition, object detection, and tagging.
- **Photo Editing Metadata**: Implement edit history and version control to enable rollbacks or undo changes.
- **Search Indexes**: Build search indexes in databases (e.g., ElasticSearch) to enable fast retrieval based on time, location, people, objects, and tags.

#### **Data Storage**

- Use **MINIO** for object storage (photos, videos).
- Use **MySQL/PostgreSQL** for relational data (user accounts, tags, album relationships).
- Backup and disaster recovery plans to protect user data.

### **4. Technical Requirements**

#### **Operating Environment**

- Frontend: Web-based application

  - Technologies: React.js(for UI), TailwindCSS/Bootstrap (for styling)

- Backend: RESTful APIs or GraphQL

  - Technologies: Node.js (Express/Koa), Python (FastAPI/Django)

- Database:

  - Relational: MySQL/PostgreSQL (user data, relationships)
  - Object Storage: MINIO (for images and videos)

- AI/ML Services:

  - OpenCV (image processing, face detection)
  - GPT or custom-trained models for tag generation
  - Third-party APIs (Remove.bg, DeepAI Inpainting) for advanced editing features

- Video Generation:

  - Python MoviePy or FFmpeg for stitching photos into videos

- Authentication & Security:

  - OAuth 2.0 / JWT for secure login and API protection
  - HTTPS for secure data transmission

- Deployment & Infrastructure:

  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes for orchestration (if needed for scaling)
  - Ali Cloud  or on-premise server support
