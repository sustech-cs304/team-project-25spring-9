## Tests for backend

Technology: jcoco

Test coverage report:http://10.16.60.67/site/jacoco/index.html

![img_1.png](backend.assets/img_1.png)

The low coverage for DTO classes and similar is due to the `@Data` annotation; in reality, they are almost fully covered. Furthermore, the actual request methods are within the controller methods, which are completely covered.

## Deployment

### Technology/Tools/Frameworks/Approaches Used for Containerization

Our project leverages **Docker** for individual service containerization and **Docker Compose** for orchestrating and managing the multi-container application. This approach offers several benefits:

- **Isolation:** Each service (backend, frontend, image processing, database, object storage) runs in its own isolated container, preventing conflicts and ensuring consistent environments.
- **Portability:** The containerized application can be easily deployed across different environments (development, testing, production) without compatibility issues.
- **Scalability:** Individual services can be scaled independently as needed.
- **Simplified Deployment:** Docker Compose streamlines the deployment process by defining all services, networks, and volumes in a single configuration file.

The key technologies and tools used are:

- **Docker Engine:** The core platform for building, running, and managing containers.
- **Docker Compose:** A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **Dockerfiles:** Used to define the build steps for each custom service image (backend, frontend, image processing).
- **Spring Boot:** Framework for the backend application.
- **Vue.js/Vite:** Framework for the frontend application.
- **Python:** Used for the `Process_Image` application.
- **MySQL:** Relational database.
- **MinIO:** S3-compatible object storage.

### Script or Related Artifacts Used for Containerization

The primary artifact for containerization is the `docker-compose.yml` file, which defines the entire multi-service application. Individual Dockerfiles within the `backend`, `frontend`, and `Process_Image` directories are used to build the specific images for those services.

Here's the `docker-compose.yml` content:

```dockerfile
version: '3.8'

services:
  backend-app:
    build: ./backend
    container_name: my-backend-app-together-1
    ports:
      - "9090:9091"
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker
    restart: unless-stopped

    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: my-frontend-app-1

  process-image-app:
    build: ./Process_Image
    ports:
      - "8123:8123"
    volumes:
      - ./Process_Image:/app
    environment:
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
    container_name: my-process-image-app-1
    restart: unless-stopped

    volumes:
      - /var/lib/mysql/software_eng_data:/var/lib/mysql
      - ./backend/table.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/table.sql

  minio:

    restart: always
    environment:

      MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: software_eng_pss
    ports:

      - "9001:9001"
    volumes:

    command: server /data --console-address ":9001"

  createbuckets:

      echo 'Waiting for MinIO to be ready...';
      sleep 10;
      echo 'Setting up MinIO alias...';
      /usr/bin/mc alias set local http://minio:9000 root software_eng_pss;
      echo 'Creating buckets...';
      /usr/bin/mc mb local/softwareeng;
      /usr/bin/mc anonymous set public local/softwareeng/;
      /usr/bin/mc mb local/softwareeng/user-img;

      echo 'Bucket creation script finished.';
      exit 0;
      "
```
